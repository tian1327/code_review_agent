    "reasons": "To determine the difficulty level of reviewing this pull request, I need to analyze both the problem statement and the patch file. [*][*]The problem statement details a need for consistency within the Django form handling mechanism by accessing values through the BoundField, simplifying code paths, and addressing potential value discrepancies. This requires moving logic from `BaseForm` to `BoundField`. The objective is clearly stated with a high-level plan for implementation.[*][*]The patch file shows a detailed implementation spread across two files: `boundfield.py` and `forms.py`. In `boundfield.py`, the logic for checking if a field has changed is moved to a new `_has_changed()` method. In `forms.py`, iterations over fields have been changed to utilize `_bound_items()`, which returns BoundField objects. The logic in the `_clean_fields()` and `changed_data()` methods has been simplified, reducing redundancy by abstracting operations that pertain to individual form fields. The patch exhibits a substantial rewrite of existing methods and introduces new ones, showing a significant refactoring effort.[*][*]The pull request introduces several modifications, including changes to method signatures and multiple areas in the codebase. Despite the problem statement providing context and overview, the complexity lies in understanding the impact of moving logic to the BoundField class and ensuring that the refactor maintains the intended behavior across different use cases. The changes involve a significant reworking of code, introducing potential regressions and requiring comprehensive testing to ensure consistency.[*][*]Given the extent of changes, the number of lines affected, the introduction of new logic in the BoundField class, and the abstract changes in data handling within forms, this pull request can be categorized as complex for a reviewer to fully anticipate all edge cases and ensure the integrity of the software is maintained."
